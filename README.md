# Web-Based Calculator Project

This is a simple web-based calculator project created by Aditya Raj. The calculator is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Performs basic arithmetic operations.
- Responsive design for seamless usage on various devices.

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Input your mathematical expressions using the provided buttons or directly via keyboard. Press the "=" button to evaluate the expression and see the result displayed on the screen.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to enhance this project by adding server-side functionalities using Node.js for mathematical computation and integrating a SQL database for storing user data. This will enable features such as saving calculation history, user authentication, and personalized settings.
