# Scientific Calculator Web App
This project builds a web-based scientific calculator using Node.js for the backend and HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend. C++ is used for computationally intensive calculations to ensure high performance.

## Project Roadmap
- [x] Deciding on technologies to be used & prototyping
- [ ] Writing tests
- [ ] Developing HTML Structure
- [ ] CSS Styling and assets
- [ ] Javascript integration
- [ ] NODE.js api for communication
- [ ] C++ Development
- [ ] Integrating C++ & NODE.js
- [ ] Full Frontend-Backend Integration
- [ ] Testing

### Technologies:

##### Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

##### Backend: Node.js, C++, Scientific libraries

##### Communication: RESTful API

### Features:

Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
Handle advanced mathematical functions (trigonometry, logarithms, exponentiation)
Perform complex operations using parentheses and order of operations
Display results with clear formatting and precision control.

### Testing
Since I'm planning for a test driven approach, writing tests becomes crucial for the development of all the individual parts of this project.
#### Testing Frameworks used:
1. gtest for cpp testing
2. jest for node testing
3. cypress for frontend-backend integration testing
